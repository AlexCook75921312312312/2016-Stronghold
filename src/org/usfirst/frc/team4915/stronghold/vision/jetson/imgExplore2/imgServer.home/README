This directory is intended to be the home of our imgServer.
imgServer.py currently it is started as follows:

./imgServer.py >& /var/tmp/imgServer.log

The default page, index.html, displays the image named "currentImage.jpg".
We assume that this image is updated by imgExplore.py at a "reasonable"
frequency.
